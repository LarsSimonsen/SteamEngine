/*
These are the battery presets for the Battery Drain calculator in the Steam Engine calculator suite.

The format of this file is a non-standard JSON with JavaScript style comments.

All batteries must have the following properties:
* nm : The name of the battery manufacturer, and the model/version name.
* q : The capacity of each cell, in mAh.

All batteries must have one of the following two properties:
* a : The maximum safe continuous amp drain of the battery.
* c : The C-rating of the battery.

Optional properties:
* s : The number of cells in series. Defaults to 1. Not in use yet.
* p : The number of cells in parallel. Defaults to 1. Not in use yet.
* t : A note/memo about the battery.
* chem : Battery chemistry. Not in use yet. Example: 'LiMn2O4'
* ff : Form factor. Not in use yet. Example: '18650'

The source URL(s) for the specifications can - and should - be be added as a JavaScript style comment, for new batteries.
